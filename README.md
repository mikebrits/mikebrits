### I love solving puzzles. 
And not just riddles and brain teasers. I love solving the kinds of problems we encounter every day. That's why I love code and design. I spend the majority of my time solving puzzles or trying to find the puzzle in a boring situation.

### Work is a part of who I am.

I currently work for booking.com as an engineering manager. I work with a talented team of developers and together we look for front end solutions at scale. I specialise in JS with a focus on React.
